Mupix is available as a command line application. If all you want to do is 
compare files, there is no need to write any code. Just install it and run
it from the command line. It should work on most platforms. **All commands
return JSON data.**

**********
Mupix Read
**********

Mupix will read symbolic music-files and return json data with Notes, Rests,
Time Signatures, Key Signatures, and, Clefs. You can even choose what data
you want to read by using flags `-n`, `-r`, `-t`, `-k`, `-c`, or have the
data be indented on output by using `-p`.

Example
#######
  You could read a file using the folloing::

    $ mupix read ./my_musicxml_file.xml

  You can `pretty-print` the text by using the `-p` option::

    $ mupix -p read ./my_musicxml_file.xml
  
  You can also use bash expansion for multiple files::

    $ mupix -p read ./xml/*

*************
Mupix Compare
*************

Comparing two files using the command line. You can even choose what data
you want to read by using flags `-n`, `-r`, `-t`, `-k`, `-c`, or have the
data be indented on output by using `-p`. Or if you're just interested in
the total, you can pass `-T`.

Example
#######

  You can compare two files using the following::

    $ mupix compare ./ground_truth.xml ./5-D.xml

  You can `pretty-print` the output::

    $ mupix -p compare ./ground_truth.xml ./5-D.xml

  You can change the Musical Marking alignment algorithm::

    $ mupix compare --sort=anw-1 ./ground_truth.xml ./5-D.xml

  You can choose what you wish to display, and combine commands together too::

    $ mupix -nt compare ./ground_truth.xml ./5-D.xml
    $ mupix -rk compare --sort=anw-1 ./ground_truth.xml ./5-D.xml
    $ mupix -ntk compare --sort=basic ./ground_truth.xml ./5-D.xml

  Just the total with `pretty-print`::

    $ mupix -pT compare ./ground_truth.xml ./5-D.xml

  You can even use bash expansion for multiple files to test against a single ground truth::

    $ mupix -pT compare ./ground_truth.xml ./xml/*

**************
Mupix Validate
**************

  You can validate MusicXML files, this process can take ~20 seconds per file::

    $ mupix validate ./testing_xml.xml

****************
Mupix xml_finder
****************

  You can identify the type of MusicXML file, either part-wise or time-wise by using
  the `xml_finder` command::

    $ mupix xml_finder ./testing_xml.xml
